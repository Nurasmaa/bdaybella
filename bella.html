<center><h2 style="color:red">Thanks for being such an amazing person and best friend, and I hope that today on your birthday <br> some of that brightness shines right back at you! You’ve been there for me through all my ups and downs, <br> and I hope you know I’m always here for you too. I never guessed when we first met that we’d become <br> best friends, or all the silly memories we’d make together! Thanks for all the fun adventures, and <br> here’s to many more in the coming year! Life should not only be lived, it should be celebrated. <br> Happy Birthday to my best friend! </h2></center>
